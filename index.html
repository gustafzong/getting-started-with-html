<h1>Web and HTML</h1>
  <h2>Web</h2>
    <p>
      Web is like a lot of connected computers which play different roles.
    </p>

    <h3>The Component of Web</h3>
        <p>
          The <b>web</b> consists of Internet and Server. And 
          <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673
          /e-48329854/m-48480496">here</a> is an explanation of its structure 
          and how it works.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <b>internet</b> is like the middle-man who take the requests of the 
          user (normally the users are ordinary people like me, and the requests 
          are like visiting a web page) and find the right server who can process 
          the request and send the request to the server, then take the response 
          from the server and give it back to user. The communication (including 
          the request and response) between them follows <b>HTTP</b>, which 
          stands for <em>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</em> and which is a 
          standard for the communication on web.
        </p>
  <h2>Communication With Computer</h2>
    <p>
      Computers are both stupid and smart. They can do calculation with great 
      efficiency. However, that is the only thing they know how to do (That's 
      why we call them computer). So we must talk to computers in a way that
      they could understand, which means, in <em>programming language</em>, 
      the order given in which could be turned into a serie of purely computing
      tasks.And we shall also eliminate even the slightest mistake because 
      computers will follow our order in any case, even when the order is 
      catastrophic.
    </p>

  <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-
      48724340"><b>HTML</b></a> is the abbreviation of <em>HyperText Markup 
      Language</em>. It's like a glue to bind everything like text, videos and 
      images together and arrange them in a specific order. In fact, when you 
      open a web page, what you get is some HTML code, which will then be 
      translated by your browser to something that is displayed on the screen.
      So the HTML code is the orders given by the server to your browser of 
      what to be displayed and the way to display them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The structure of a HTML file is like <a href="https://www.udacity.com/
      course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48748025">this</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Concepts in HTML</h3>
        <h4>Tag</h4>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873
            828673/m-48723444">Tags</a> are used to describe how should the 
            content be displayed. There are also tags which has no corresponding
            contents. These tags are called <em>void tag</em>
          </p>
        <h4>Element</h4>
          <p>
            Elements are components of HTML file, for example, a tag as a whole
            could be called an element. There are <a href="https://www.udacity.
            com/course/viewer/#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723438">inline elements
            and block elements</a>. Block elements is like an invisible box
            which contains the content inside it.
          </p>
